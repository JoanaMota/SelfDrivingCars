My notes and exercises from the Coursera SelfDrivingCars Course

## [Applying Stereo Depth to a Driving Scenario](https://github.com/JoanaMota/SelfDrivingCars/tree/main/VisualPerception/Module1-StereoDepth)

## [Visual Odometry for Localization in Autonomous Driving](https://github.com/JoanaMota/SelfDrivingCars/tree/main/VisualPerception/Module2-VisualOdometry)

# Prerequisites

Some of the algorithms may need the `opencv-contrib` package, so make sure to install/update the following:

```
pip3 install opencv-python
pip3 install opencv-contrib-python
```
